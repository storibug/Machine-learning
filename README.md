# Machine-learning
test 1:
A simple code to work on neural networks with a single hidden layer and predefined dataset. 
The activation function used is sigmoid 

test2:
A code using tanh function the activation function in an artificial neural network similar to test1

test3:
A code similar to the previous one with Leaky Relu activation function

test 1_3 and test 1_4 uses Gaussian NAive BAyes algorithm and Support Vector Machine on IRIS dataset with z-score and MINMAX
normalisations respectively
The IRIS dataset is a public dataset available in UCI repositories
